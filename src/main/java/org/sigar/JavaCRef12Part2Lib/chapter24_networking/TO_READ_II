The `java.net` package provides classes and interfaces for networking operations in Java. These are crucial for building networked applications such as client-server architectures, web applications, and distributed systems.

### **Key Interfaces in `java.net` Package**

1. **`SocketOptions`**
   - **Purpose**: Defines methods to configure low-level socket options.
   - **Usage**: Provides methods to set and get options on `Socket` and `DatagramSocket`.
   - **Most Common Implementation**:
     - `SocketImpl`: It implements low-level socket functionality and can be used to manipulate socket options such as timeout, buffer size, etc.

2. **`ContentHandlerFactory`**
   - **Purpose**: Used to create `ContentHandler` objects, which are responsible for handling specific content types (MIME types).
   - **Usage**: Primarily used in URL communication to handle different types of content, like text, images, etc.
   - **Most Common Implementation**:
     - The default implementation is provided when you use URL connections, but you can create a custom one by subclassing `ContentHandler`.

3. **`URLStreamHandlerFactory`**
   - **Purpose**: Factory interface for creating `URLStreamHandler` instances, which handle protocols for URLs (such as HTTP, FTP).
   - **Usage**: Allows developers to customize how protocols are handled for URL connections.
   - **Most Common Implementation**:
     - Standard `URLStreamHandler` implementation for protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP is provided by the JDK.

4. **`FileNameMap`**
   - **Purpose**: Maps a filename to a MIME type.
   - **Usage**: It is used in conjunction with URLs to determine the MIME type of a file based on its name or extension.
   - **Most Common Implementation**:
     - The `URLConnection.getFileNameMap()` method provides a default implementation that maps file extensions to content types.

5. **`CookieHandler`**
   - **Purpose**: Represents a mechanism for managing HTTP cookies.
   - **Usage**: Used in applications that need to manage cookies while communicating with web servers.
   - **Most Common Implementation**:
     - `java.net.CookieManager`: A concrete implementation that stores cookies in memory and provides automatic cookie handling.

6. **`URLConnectionFactory`**
   - **Purpose**: Factory interface for creating `URLConnection` objects.
   - **Usage**: Used to customize how URL connections are created, such as in the context of proxy servers or secure connections.
   - **Most Common Implementation**:
     - Default `HttpURLConnection` for HTTP connections, or you can implement custom factories for specific protocols.

### **Most Widely Used Interfaces and Their Implementations**

1. **`SocketAddress`**
   - **Purpose**: Encapsulates an address for a `Socket` or `ServerSocket`.
   - **Most Common Implementation**:
     - **`InetSocketAddress`**: Combines an IP address (or hostname) and a port number. Widely used for both client and server-side socket connections.
     ```java
     InetSocketAddress address = new InetSocketAddress("localhost", 8080);
     ```

2. **`SocketImpl`**
   - **Purpose**: Provides the mechanism to implement the low-level functionality for `Socket` objects.
   - **Most Common Implementation**:
     - **`PlainSocketImpl`**: The default implementation used for basic socket functionality. This is used internally by Java’s networking classes like `Socket` and `ServerSocket`.

3. **`DatagramSocketImpl`**
   - **Purpose**: Defines the methods for low-level operations of a datagram (UDP) socket.
   - **Most Common Implementation**:
     - **`DefaultDatagramSocketImpl`**: The default implementation provided by the JDK for sending and receiving datagram packets.

4. **`ContentHandler`**
   - **Purpose**: Handles the reading of an object from a URL stream.
   - **Most Common Implementation**:
     - **`FileNameMap`**: Maps filenames to MIME types, used for content handlers that process different file types.

5. **`ProxySelector`**
   - **Purpose**: Selects the proxy server to be used for connecting to a URL.
   - **Most Common Implementation**:
     - **`DefaultProxySelector`**: This is the default selector, but you can override it to create custom proxy rules for network connections.
     - Custom implementations allow for more sophisticated rules in enterprise environments where different proxies might be used for different protocols.

6. **`CookiePolicy`**
   - **Purpose**: Determines whether cookies should be accepted or rejected.
   - **Most Common Implementation**:
     - **`CookieManager`**: Implements the cookie handling mechanism. It allows you to set a custom `CookiePolicy` to manage whether cookies should be accepted or rejected.

7. **`CookieStore`**
   - **Purpose**: Defines methods for storing and retrieving cookies.
   - **Most Common Implementation**:
     - **`DefaultCookieStore`**: Used by `CookieManager` to store cookies in memory. You can create custom `CookieStore` implementations for persistent storage like databases or files.

### **Examples of Common Implementations in Action**

1. **Socket Communication Example Using `InetSocketAddress` and `Socket`**
   ```java
   import java.net.InetSocketAddress;
   import java.net.Socket;

   public class ClientExample {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           try (Socket socket = new Socket()) {
               // Connect to the server
               InetSocketAddress address = new InetSocketAddress("localhost", 8080);
               socket.connect(address, 5000);  // 5-second timeout

               // Now communicate with the server
               System.out.println("Connected to server: " + socket.getRemoteSocketAddress());
           } catch (Exception e) {
               e.printStackTrace();
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Cookie Management Example Using `CookieManager` and `CookiePolicy`**
   ```java
   import java.net.CookieManager;
   import java.net.CookiePolicy;
   import java.net.HttpURLConnection;
   import java.net.URL;

   public class CookieExample {
       public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
           // Set up the CookieManager with a custom policy
           CookieManager cookieManager = new CookieManager();
           cookieManager.setCookiePolicy(CookiePolicy.ACCEPT_ALL);
           java.net.CookieHandler.setDefault(cookieManager);

           // Create a connection
           URL url = new URL("http://www.example.com");
           HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();

           // Handle cookies automatically
           connection.getContent();
       }
   }
   ```

### **Summary of Most Widely Used Interfaces and Implementations**
