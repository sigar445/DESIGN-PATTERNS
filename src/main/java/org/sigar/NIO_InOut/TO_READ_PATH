The `Path` interface, introduced in Java NIO.2 (Java 7), provides an abstraction to represent a file path in the file system. It encapsulates the location of a file or directory in the file system, making it more flexible than the old `File` class from earlier Java versions. `Path` is part of the `java.nio.file` package and is key to NIO.2's enhanced file-handling features.

### Key Features of `Path`:

1. **Encapsulation of a File Path**:
   - A `Path` object represents a path to a file or directory. This can be an absolute path (starting from the root) or a relative path (relative to some other path).

2. **Integration with NIO.2 Features**:
   - Many NIO.2 classes use `Path` objects as the primary way to handle file operations (like reading, writing, copying, moving, etc.). It works seamlessly with the `Files` class in Java for various file operations.

3. **Platform Independence**:
   - It handles system-dependent path separators (such as `\` on Windows and `/` on UNIX/Linux) internally, making the code platform-independent.

4. **Path Inheritance**:
   - `Path` inherits three important interfaces:
     - **Watchable**: Allows the `Path` to be registered for monitoring changes (e.g., file creation, deletion, modification).
     - **Comparable<Path>**: `Path` objects can be compared, enabling sorting and other comparison-based operations.
     - **Iterable<Path>**: A `Path` object can be treated as a collection of path elements (such as directory names), allowing iteration through each component of the path.

### `Path` Key Methods:

- **`getFileName()`**: Returns the name of the file or directory represented by the `Path`.
- **`getParent()`**: Returns the `Path` representing the parent directory.
- **`toAbsolutePath()`**: Converts a relative path into an absolute path.
- **`register(WatchService watcher, WatchEvent.Kind<?>... events)`**: Registers the `Path` with a `WatchService` to monitor file events.
- **`compareTo(Path other)`**: Compares two `Path` objects lexicographically.

### Example Using `Watchable`, `Comparable`, and `Iterable`:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.*;
import java.nio.file.attribute.BasicFileAttributes;
import java.util.Iterator;

public class PathExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, InterruptedException {
        // 1. Create a Path object
        Path path = Paths.get("example_directory/example_file.txt");

        // --- Watchable Interface ---
        // Watch for changes in the directory where the file resides
        WatchService watchService = FileSystems.getDefault().newWatchService();
        Path dirPath = Paths.get("example_directory"); // Directory path

        // Register the directory with the WatchService to monitor for CREATE, DELETE, and MODIFY events
        dirPath.register(watchService, StandardWatchEventKinds.ENTRY_CREATE,
                         StandardWatchEventKinds.ENTRY_DELETE,
                         StandardWatchEventKinds.ENTRY_MODIFY);

        // Start a thread to watch for changes in the directory
        new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                WatchKey key;
                while ((key = watchService.take()) != null) {
                    for (WatchEvent<?> event : key.pollEvents()) {
                        System.out.println("Event kind: " + event.kind() +
                                           ". File affected: " + event.context() + ".");
                    }
                    key.reset();
                }
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
        }).start();

        // --- Comparable Interface ---
        // Compare two paths lexicographically
        Path anotherPath = Paths.get("example_directory/another_file.txt");
        int comparisonResult = path.compareTo(anotherPath);

        if (comparisonResult < 0) {
            System.out.println(path.getFileName() + " comes before " + anotherPath.getFileName());
        } else if (comparisonResult > 0) {
            System.out.println(path.getFileName() + " comes after " + anotherPath.getFileName());
        } else {
            System.out.println(path.getFileName() + " is the same as " + anotherPath.getFileName());
        }

        // --- Iterable Interface ---
        // Iterate over the components of the Path
        System.out.println("Path components:");
        for (Path part : path) {
            System.out.println(part);
        }

        // Alternatively, using iterator explicitly
        System.out.println("\nPath components (using Iterator):");
        Iterator<Path> iterator = path.iterator();
        while (iterator.hasNext()) {
            System.out.println(iterator.next());
        }

        // Give the watch service some time to catch file changes (you can modify files in the directory to trigger events)
        Thread.sleep(10000); // Sleep for 10 seconds to allow the watch service to capture events
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **`Watchable` (Monitoring File System Changes)**:
   - The `Path` object (`dirPath`) is registered with a `WatchService` to monitor events like file creation, deletion, and modification. A new thread is started to handle these events asynchronously.
   - When a change happens in the directory (like creating or modifying `example_file.txt`), an event is printed out.

2. **`Comparable<Path>` (Comparing Paths)**:
   - The `compareTo()` method compares two `Path` objects lexicographically. It outputs which file comes first or whether they are the same.

3. **`Iterable<Path>` (Iterating Over Path Components)**:
   - The `Path` object can be iterated over as a sequence of its individual components (e.g., `example_directory` and `example_file.txt`). This demonstrates the `Iterable` functionality of `Path`.

### Summary:
- `Path` in NIO.2 is a versatile and powerful interface used for working with file and directory paths.
- It integrates with the `WatchService` for monitoring file system events, supports lexicographical comparison via `Comparable<Path>`, and allows iteration over its components with `Iterable<Path>`.
- The provided example demonstrates how to monitor changes, compare paths, and iterate through path components in a flexible and platform-independent manner.
