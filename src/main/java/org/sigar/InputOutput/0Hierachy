### **InputStream and Its Hierarchy**

`InputStream` is an abstract class in Java representing an input stream of bytes. The core function of an `InputStream` is to read bytes from a source (e.g., a file, network, or memory buffer).

#### **Hierarchy of InputStream**

- **`java.lang.Object`**
  - **`java.io.InputStream`** (Abstract Class)
    - **`ByteArrayInputStream`**
    - **`FileInputStream`**
    - **`FilterInputStream`**
      - **`BufferedInputStream`**
      - **`DataInputStream`**
      - **`PushbackInputStream`**
    - **`PipedInputStream`**
    - **`SequenceInputStream`**
    - **`StringBufferInputStream`** (deprecated)

#### **Most Used Subclasses of InputStream and Their Use Cases**

1. **`FileInputStream`**
   - **Purpose**: Used for reading raw byte streams from a file.
   - **Use Case**: Reading binary data, such as image files, or when reading large text files where handling bytes directly is necessary.
   - **Example**:
     ```java
     FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("file.txt");
     ```

2. **`BufferedInputStream`**
   - **Purpose**: Buffers the input stream to improve performance by reducing the number of IO operations.
   - **Use Case**: Wrapping around `FileInputStream` or other input streams when reading large files to reduce disk access times.
   - **Example**:
     ```java
     BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream("file.txt"));
     ```

3. **`ByteArrayInputStream`**
   - **Purpose**: Allows reading from an in-memory byte array as if it were an input stream.
   - **Use Case**: Testing or reading small chunks of data that are already in memory.
   - **Example**:
     ```java
     byte[] data = "Hello".getBytes();
     ByteArrayInputStream bais = new ByteArrayInputStream(data);
     ```

4. **`DataInputStream`**
   - **Purpose**: Allows reading of Java primitive data types from an input stream in a machine-independent way.
   - **Use Case**: Reading binary data that includes Java primitive types (int, float, etc.).
   - **Example**:
     ```java
     DataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(new FileInputStream("data.bin"));
     int value = dis.readInt();
     ```

5. **`PipedInputStream`**
   - **Purpose**: Allows reading from a pipe, which is useful for communication between threads.
   - **Use Case**: Inter-thread communication where one thread writes data to a `PipedOutputStream` and another reads it from the corresponding `PipedInputStream`.
   - **Example**:
     ```java
     PipedInputStream pis = new PipedInputStream(pipedOutputStream);
     ```

6. **`SequenceInputStream`**
   - **Purpose**: Concatenates multiple input streams and reads them sequentially.
   - **Use Case**: Reading from multiple files or input sources as if they were a single stream.
   - **Example**:
     ```java
     SequenceInputStream sis = new SequenceInputStream(new FileInputStream("file1.txt"), new FileInputStream("file2.txt"));
     ```

### **OutputStream and Its Subclasses**

`OutputStream` is an abstract class in Java used to write data to a destination, typically an output device, file, or network socket.

#### **Hierarchy of OutputStream**

- **`java.lang.Object`**
  - **`java.io.OutputStream`** (Abstract Class)
    - **`ByteArrayOutputStream`**
    - **`FileOutputStream`**
    - **`FilterOutputStream`**
      - **`BufferedOutputStream`**
      - **`DataOutputStream`**
      - **`PrintStream`**
    - **`PipedOutputStream`**

#### **Most Used Subclasses of OutputStream and Their Use Cases**

1. **`FileOutputStream`**
   - **Purpose**: Writes raw bytes to a file.
   - **Use Case**: Writing binary data (e.g., images, audio files) or when writing to a file byte by byte.
   - **Example**:
     ```java
     FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("output.txt");
     ```

2. **`BufferedOutputStream`**
   - **Purpose**: Buffers the output stream, improving performance by reducing IO operations.
   - **Use Case**: Wrapping around `FileOutputStream` or other output streams to improve write performance when writing large files.
   - **Example**:
     ```java
     BufferedOutputStream bos = new BufferedOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("output.txt"));
     ```

3. **`ByteArrayOutputStream`**
   - **Purpose**: Writes data to an in-memory byte array.
   - **Use Case**: Writing temporary data in memory, useful for building a byte stream before saving to a file.
   - **Example**:
     ```java
     ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
     baos.write("Hello".getBytes());
     ```

4. **`DataOutputStream`**
   - **Purpose**: Allows writing of Java primitive data types to an output stream in a machine-independent way.
   - **Use Case**: Writing structured data that contains Java primitive types like `int`, `float`, etc.
   - **Example**:
     ```java
     DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("data.bin"));
     dos.writeInt(42);
     ```

5. **`PrintStream`**
   - **Purpose**: Allows writing formatted data (strings, primitives) to an output stream.
   - **Use Case**: Writing human-readable text to a console or file, often used in logging or printing debug information.
   - **Example**:
     ```java
     PrintStream ps = new PrintStream(new FileOutputStream("log.txt"));
     ps.println("Logging message");
     ```

6. **`PipedOutputStream`**
   - **Purpose**: Used to write to a pipe, which is typically connected to a `PipedInputStream`.
   - **Use Case**: Inter-thread communication where one thread writes data to a `PipedOutputStream` and another reads it from the corresponding `PipedInputStream`.
   - **Example**:
     ```java
     PipedOutputStream pos = new PipedOutputStream(pipedInputStream);
     ```

### **Conclusion**
- **`InputStream` Hierarchy**: Represents sources from which bytes can be read.
- **`OutputStream` Hierarchy**: Represents destinations to which bytes can be written.
- **Most Common Use Cases**: Handling file IO, network streams, in-memory buffers, inter-thread communication, and reading/writing primitive data types.
