### 1. **FileInputStream:**

The `FileInputStream` class is used for reading raw byte data from a file. It reads the file byte by byte, which can be inefficient when reading large files because it doesn't employ buffering.

#### Key Characteristics:
- Reads raw bytes from a file.
- Doesn't use any buffering.
- Typically used for reading binary data such as images, audio, etc.
- Reads data directly from the file system, which can be slower for repeated read operations.

#### Common Methods:
- **`int read()`**: Reads one byte of data from the file and returns it as an integer. If the end of the file is reached, it returns `-1`.
- **`int read(byte[] b)`**: Reads up to `b.length` bytes of data into the specified byte array and returns the number of bytes read.
- **`int available()`**: Returns the number of remaining bytes that can be read from the file without blocking.
- **`void close()`**: Closes the input stream and releases any system resources associated with the file.

### 2. **BufferedInputStream:**

The `BufferedInputStream` class wraps an `InputStream` (like `FileInputStream`) and adds a buffer to it, which improves performance. It reads a larger chunk of data into memory (buffer) at once and serves data from this buffer rather than directly accessing the file system each time.

#### Key Characteristics:
- Wraps around an `InputStream`, typically a `FileInputStream`.
- Uses a buffer to read data in chunks, which reduces the number of file I/O operations.
- Increases efficiency by minimizing direct disk access.
- Suitable for scenarios where data needs to be read frequently or in large chunks.

#### Common Methods:
- **`int read()`**: Reads one byte of data from the input stream. If the buffer is empty, it refills it from the underlying stream.
- **`int read(byte[] b, int off, int len)`**: Reads up to `len` bytes from the input stream into the specified byte array starting at the offset `off`.
- **`void mark(int readlimit)`**: Marks the current position in the stream. The `readlimit` parameter specifies how many bytes can be read before the mark position becomes invalid.
- **`void reset()`**: Resets the stream to the most recent mark.
- **`boolean markSupported()`**: Returns `true` if the stream supports the `mark` and `reset` methods.
- **`void close()`**: Closes the stream and releases any system resources.

### Key Differences:
1. **Buffering:**
   - `FileInputStream` doesn't use any buffer.
   - `BufferedInputStream` adds a buffer to optimize read operations.

2. **Performance:**
   - `FileInputStream` is slower for repeated read operations because it reads directly from the disk.
   - `BufferedInputStream` is faster because it minimizes disk I/O by reading larger chunks of data at once into memory.

3. **Usage:**
   - `FileInputStream` is better suited for small files or scenarios where buffering is not necessary.
   - `BufferedInputStream` is ideal when reading larger files or when performance is a concern due to frequent reading.

In practice, `BufferedInputStream` is often used when reading from files to improve efficiency, especially when working with larger data.
