The error occurs because GitHub no longer supports password authentication for Git operations. Instead, GitHub recommends using Personal Access Tokens (PAT) or SSH keys for authentication. Here’s how you can set it up:

### Step 1: Create a Personal Access Token (PAT)
1. Go to your GitHub account: [GitHub Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
2. Click on **"Generate new token"**.
3. Provide a note for the token, like "Git operations".
4. Select the appropriate scopes; usually, the `repo` scope is enough for pushing code to your repositories.
5. Click **"Generate token"**.
6. Copy the token. **(Note: This is your only chance to copy it; you won’t be able to see it again!)**

### Step 2: Update Git Authentication with the PAT
When you perform a `git push`, instead of your password, use the generated token as your password.

### Step 3: Push Using PAT
1. Run the following command to push your code:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```
2. When prompted for your username, enter your GitHub username (`sigar445`).
3. When prompted for the password, paste your Personal Access Token.

### Step 4: Cache Your PAT for Convenience (Optional)
To avoid entering your PAT each time, you can use Git’s credential helper:
1. Run the following command to cache your credentials:
   ```bash
   git config --global credential.helper cache
   ```
2. Alternatively, you can store the credentials permanently:
   ```bash
   git config --global credential.helper store
   ```
   After running this, enter your username and PAT once, and Git will remember them for future operations.

### Alternative: Set Up SSH Key (Recommended for Frequent Use)
1. Generate an SSH key using:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```
2. Add the generated SSH key to your GitHub account:
   - Copy the SSH key:
     ```bash
     cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
     ```
   - Go to GitHub: **Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH Key** and paste the key.
3. Change the remote URL to use SSH:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:sigar445/DESIGN-PATTERNS.git
   ```
4. Now, use:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

Using PATs or SSH keys will keep your repositories secure and compliant with GitHub’s current authentication requirements. Let me know if you need further assistance!
