I'd be glad to explain the major components of Java NIO (New I/O) and how they interact:

**Core Components:**

1. **Channels:**
   - Open connections to I/O resources (files, sockets, etc.).
   - Non-blocking I/O operations, allowing multiple operations to be initiated without waiting for completion.
   - Types:
      - `SocketChannel`: For network communication.
      - `FileChannel`: For file I/O.
      - `DatagramChannel`: For UDP communication.
      - `Selector`: Monitors multiple channels for events (read, write, connect, accept).
      - `ByteBuffer`: Stores data in a byte buffer, allowing efficient data manipulation.
      - `Charset`: Encodes and decodes characters to and from bytes.

2. **Selectors:**
   - Efficiently monitor multiple channels for events (read, write, connect, accept).
   - Avoids blocking the main thread while waiting for events.
   - `select()` method checks for events on registered channels.
   - `keys()` method returns a set of selected keys.
   - `wakeup()` method wakes up a blocked thread.

3. **Buffers:**
   - Stores data in a byte buffer, allowing efficient data manipulation.
   - Types:
      - `ByteBuffer`: Most commonly used for general-purpose byte buffers.
      - `CharBuffer`: For character data.
      - `IntBuffer`: For integer data.
      - `LongBuffer`: For long integer data.
      - `FloatBuffer`: For floating-point data.
      - `DoubleBuffer`: For double-precision floating-point data.
   - Methods:
      - `flip()`: Switches between reading and writing modes.
      - `clear()`: Clears the buffer for reuse.
      - `compact()`: Moves unread data to the beginning of the buffer.
      - `position()`: Gets or sets the current position in the buffer.
      - `limit()`: Gets or sets the maximum position in the buffer.

**How They Interact:**

1. **Channel Creation:**
   - Create a channel using the appropriate factory method (e.g., `SocketChannel.open()`).
   - Configure the channel as needed (e.g., non-blocking mode).

2. **Channel Registration:**
   - Register the channel with a selector using the `select()` method.
   - Specify the desired events (read, write, connect, accept).

3. **Selector Selection:**
   - Call the `select()` method on the selector.
   - It blocks until one or more channels have events.
   - Returns the number of channels with events.

4. **Event Handling:**
   - Iterate over the selected keys.
   - Use the `key()` method to get the channel associated with the key.
   - Determine the type of event (read, write, connect, accept).
   - Perform the appropriate I/O operation using the channel and a buffer.

**Example:**

``java
import java.nio.channels.*;
import java.nio.ByteBuffer;
import java.util.*;

public class NioExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Create a selector
        Selector selector = Selector.open();

        // Create a non-blocking socket channel
        SocketChannel channel = SocketChannel.open();
        channel.configureBlocking(false);

        // Register the channel with the selector for read events
        SelectionKey key = channel.register(selector, SelectionKey.OP_READ);

        // Wait for events
        while (true) {
            int readyChannels = selector.select();
            if (readyChannels == 0) {
                continue;
            }

            Set<SelectionKey> selectedKeys = selector.selectedKeys();
            Iterator<SelectionKey> iter = selectedKeys.iterator();
            while (iter.hasNext()) {
                SelectionKey key = iter.next();
                iter.remove();

                if (key.isReadable()) {
                    // Read data from the channel
                    ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);
                    int bytesRead = channel.read(buffer);
                    if (bytesRead > 0) {
                        buffer.flip();
                        // Process the data
                        System.out.println(new String(buffer.array(), 0, bytesRead));
                    }
                }

                // Handle other events as needed (write, connect, accept)
            }
        }
    }
}

This example demonstrates the basic steps of using NIO: creating a selector, registering a channel, waiting for events, and handling events.
